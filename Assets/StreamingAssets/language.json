    "stage1MissionText6": "For the first mission of the day, We need you to drive to the end of this course.",
    "stage1MissionText7": "Before you start you should know about motion.",
    "stage1MissionText8": "Motion is the change in the position of an object.",
    "stage1MissionText9": "By driving to the end of this course we use the motion of our vehicle to change our position.",
    "stage1MissionText10": "It's important to know that the energy of motion we use to drive our vehicle is a kind of mechanical energy.",
    "stage1MissionText11": "Let's get started.",
    "stage1MissionText12": "Before the vehicle can move we need to choose one of two upgrades. You can increase the motion of the car or increase the friction of the car.",
    "stage1MissionText13": "We are going to need to be going fast to clear the gap in the jump. Choose your upgrade now!",
    "stage1MissionText14": "Excellent. You can accelerate and brake with the up and down arrows or the W and S keys. Use the left and right arrows, or the A and D keys to steer.",
    "stage1MissionText15": "We will catch up more at the end of the course.",
    "stage1MissionText16Correct": "Well done! Adding an upgrade to increase motion allowed us to clear the gap. Remember motion is the change in the position of an object.",
    "stage1MissionText17": "Excellent work. That's the first course tested. Lets move onto track 2.",
    "stage1MissionText18Incorrect1": "Looks like you increased the friction of the car and it slowed us down so much we didnt make the jump.",
    "stage1MissionText19Incorrect2": "Please choose a new upgrade for your vehicle!",
    "stage1MissionText20CorrectNMJ": "Oh looks you made the correct upgrade but didnt quite make the jump. Try again!.",

    "stage2MissionText2ChooseCar": "Can you please choose a vehicle to drive?",
    "stage2MissionText3": "Before we get testing the course, we need to talk about energy.",

     "stage2MissionText8": "The first set of boxes is colored blue and labeled Energy. The other set of boxes is colored red and labeled Resistance.",
     "stage2MissionText9": "You need to use the info on the side of the screen to decide which color of boxes need removing.",

     "stage2MissionText11": "It's important to know that each set of boxes will affect your vehicle.",
     "stage2MissionText12": "Energy boxes will increase your speed, Resistance boxes however will slow you down.",
     "stage2MissionText13": "There is a large pile of boxes at the very end.",
     "stage2MissionText14": "You'll need to build up enough energy through the motion of the vehicle to knock the final pile of boxes off the course.",
     "stage2MissionText15": "Let’s get going.",
     "stage2MissionText16": "Oh those boxes seemed to have slowed you down. You're going to slow now. Lets start again.",
     "stage2MissionText17": "Well done, those were the correct boxes to remove and your vehicle has gained speed. Can you remove the rest of them?",
     "stage2MissionText18": "Here comes the final pile of boxes. Let’s hope you have enough speed.",
     "stage2MissionText19": "Well done, We used the energy of motion from our moving vehicles to clear all the incorrect boxes off the course",
     "stage2MissionText20": "Let’s head over to course 3!",
     "stage2MissionText21": "Looks like you didn't remove enough boxes.",
     "stage2MissionText22": "Remember that the motion of our vehicle contains energy. Let’s use that information and try again.",

     "stage3MissionText2ChooseCar": "Please choose a vehicle!",
     "stage3MissionText3": "Let's talk about speed and energy some more.",
     "stage3MissionText4": "Speed is the rate at which an object changes its position.",
     "stage3MissionText5": "The greater the speed of an object the more energy it possesses.",
     "stage3MissionText6": "Along this course are 3 walls",
     "stage3MissionText7": "Your task is to gain speed and energy through the motion of your vehicle and to drive through each wall and destroy it.",
     "stage3MissionText8": "If you don't reach the speed required to break each wall, you will be stopped dead in your tracks and you’ll need to try again from the start.",
     "stage3MissionText9": "Be aware that there are objects on the track that will slow you down, you need to avoid the obstacles as you gain speed and energy.",
     "stage3MissionText10": "The amount of speed you’ll need for each wall is on the side of the screen now.",
     "stage3MissionText11": "Let’s get going!",
     "stage3MissionText12": "Oh, you didn't build up enough speed to break this wall. The required speeds are on the side of the screen. Try again.",
     "stage3MissionText13": "Well done! Onto the next wall!",
     "stage3MissionText14": "Excellent. Two walls down. One left!",
     "stage3MissionText15": "That’s the last wall. Now go as fast as you can to make it round the loop.",
     "stage3MissionText16": "Well done. You are a fantastic driver. We saw firsthand that the greater the speed of an object, the more energy it possesses.",
     "stage3MissionText17": "One course left to test. Let's head over to it now.",
     "stage4MissionText1": "Welcome to the final stage of testing folks. Today we’re going bowling!",
     "stage4MissionText2": "Before we get driving, we're going to talk a bit more about energy.",
     "stage4MissionText3": "Energy can be moved from place to place by moving objects.",
     "stage4MissionText4": "At the end of the course is a giant bowling ball.",
     "stage4MissionText5": "We are going to drive the course to increase the motion and energy of our vehicle and then knock over a set of bowling pins with a giant bowling ball.",
     "stage4MissionText6": "By doing this, we take the energy built up by our vehicle's motion and transfer it into the bowling ball, which will then transfer the power from our ball into the pins.",
     "stage4MissionText7": "The aim of this stage is to use the energy built up in our vehicle to knock down 5 or more pins off the course and clear it for our race.",
     "stage4MissionText8ChooseVehicle": "Please choose a vehicle.",
     "stage4MissionText9": "Be aware there are objects on the course that will slow you down if you hit them.",
     "stage4MissionText10": "You need to reach at least 50mph to knock down enough pins.",
     "stage4MissionText11": "Let's get going!",
     "stage4MissionText12": "Looks like you didn't knock down enough pins. Let's put you back and the start and try again.",
     "stage4MissionText13": "Fantastic. You knocked over enough pins to clear the course.",
     "stage4MissionText14": "Now the Robo League championship can begin.",
     "stage4MissionText15": "I hope you have a better understanding of the motion and energy.",
     "stage4MissionText16": "Motion and energy exist in everything we see and do. It's an integral area of physics that helps us understand how the world works.",
